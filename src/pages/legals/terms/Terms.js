          will (in addition to other remedies) without delay return all payments

          <br />
          a. foodstuffs, beverages or other goods intended for current
          consumption in the household and which are supplied on frequent and
          regular rounds to your residence or workplace;

          39. Also, the Cancellation Rights for a Contract cease to be available
          in the following circumstances:
          <br />
          a. in the case of any sales contract, if the goods become mixed
          inseparably (according to their nature) with other items after
          delivery.

          <em>Right to cancel</em>

          this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          41. The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on
          which you acquire, or a third party, other than the carrier indicated
          by you, acquires physical possession of the last of the Goods. In a
          contract for the supply of goods over time (ie subscriptions), the
          right to cancel will be 14 days after the first delivery.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          42. To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your
          decision to cancel this Contract by a clear statement setting out your
          decision (eg a letter sent by post or email). You can use the attached
          model cancellation form, but it is not obligatory. In any event, you
          must be able to show clear evidence of when the cancellation was made,
          so you may decide to use the model cancellation form.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          43. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model
          cancellation form or any other clear statement of the Customer's
          decision to cancel the Contract on our website xxx. If you use this
          option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of
          such a cancellation in a Durable Medium (eg by email) without delay.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          44. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to

          <em>Effects of cancellation in the cancellation period</em>

          45. Except as set out below, if you cancel this Contract, we will
          reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs
          of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you chose a
          type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard
          delivery offered by us).

        <div className="termsContent">
          <em>Deduction for goods supplied</em>
          <br />
          46. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value
          of any Goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary
          handling by you (ie handling the Goods beyond what is necessary to
          establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Goods: eg
          it goes beyond the sort of handling that might be reasonably allowed
          in a shop). This is because you are liable for that loss and, if that
          deduction is not made, you must pay us the amount of that loss.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          <em>Timing of reimbursement</em>

          reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:
          <br />
          a. 14 days after the day we receive back from you any Goods supplied,
          or
          <br />
          b. (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you
          have sent back the Goods.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          48. If we have offered to collect the Goods or if no Goods were
          supplied, we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not
          later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your
          decision to cancel this Contract.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          49. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as
          you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed
          otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of
          the reimbursement.
        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          <em>Returning goods</em>
          <br />
          50. If you have received Goods in connection with the Contract which
          you have cancelled, you must send back the Goods or hand them over to
          us at xxx, xxx, xxx, xxx without delay and in any event not later than
          14 days from the day on which you communicate to us your cancellation
          of this Contract. The deadline is met if you send back the Goods
          before the period of 14 days has expired. You agree that you will have
          to bear the cost of returning the Goods.

        <div className="termsContent">
          51. For the purposes of these Cancellation Rights, these words have
          the following meanings:

          a. distance contract means a contract concluded between a trader and a
          consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme
          without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the
          consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance
          communication up to and including the time at which the contract is
          concluded;
          <br />
          b. sales contract means a contract under which a trader transfers or
          agrees to transfer the ownership of goods to a consumer and the
          consumer pays or agrees to pay the price, including any contract that

        <div className="termsSubtitle">Conformity</div>

          52. We have a legal duty to supply the Goods in conformity with the

        </div>
        <div className="termsContent">
          53. Upon delivery, the Goods will:

          b. be reasonably fit for any particular purpose for which you buy the
          Goods which, before the Contract is made, you made known to us (unless
          you do not actually rely, or it is unreasonable for you to rely, on
          our skill and judgment) and be fit for any purpose held out by us or
          set out in the Contract; and
